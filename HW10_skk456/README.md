Geo-Spatial Analysis -

I set the Summer time start from March until August while the rest is considered as the Winter time.
Overall, the results show a positive autocorrelation between one area and its neighbors in New York.

For this assignment I worked with Vishwajeet. I did most of the coding by myself. We discussed the meanings of the plots and maps together.
