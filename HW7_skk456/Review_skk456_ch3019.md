# Review for Homework 7 plot
**Reviewer:** Cheng Hou

---

The plot is quite good. The plot is easy to understand but I have some advices to make the plot better. First, showing the quantities above the bars could be better. Second, showing the 3 types independently or dividing the bar of 'Total' into 3 parts (showing the 3 types accumulate) may be better.
