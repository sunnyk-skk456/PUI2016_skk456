Assignment

I built this plot by myself.

The plot is about the Restaurants in New York City boroughs with cuisine types - American, Italian and Mexican and one that have received a Critical rating in their inspection that was performed by Health Dept. in Aug 2014

A stacked plot is charted in this assignment. It gives an idea of the restaurants with poor inspection ratings with their cuisine types and their location across the New York City.

Thank you.

Best,
Sunny K.
