<br>1.If the fonts of y-label could be bigger,the whole plot will be more clear.
<br>2.I think more constrative color would be better, especially for "Total" and "American".
<br>3.I suggest that the number of total restaurant by borough should be marked above the bars.
<br>that would be much better than putting them below the bars.
<br>4.Also I think a x-label named "Boroughs" could be added.
<br>Generally it is a really good plot,I have to be picky to make some suggestions.It is clear
<br>to deliver the information!
