## HW5_skk456

### Assignment 1: Compare Tests for Goodness of fit (on real data)
 - Used KS Test and AD test
 - Tested for Normal and Exponential Distribution
 - Null Hypothesis $H_0$ is formulated for each test.
 - Reasoning is provided if Null Hypothesis is accepted or rejected.
 
 
 ### Assignment 2: Line fitting and data munging with income gender bias.
 - Gender Income Gap is evaluated in this exercise.
 - In Exploratory Phase, scatter_matrix function from pandas is used to understand relationship within data.
 - Total Median Income for females and males is checked to see how they relate to each other.
 - Graphs are plotted to conclude women are paid less than men, for the same position.
 - Stipend value is assumed for men and a prediction is made that women would be paid less for the same positions.
  
### Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis
 - For the 4 experiments Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) is documented in text and formulae.
 
 
### I have worked along with Chenxi Cui (cc5219) for this assignment.
