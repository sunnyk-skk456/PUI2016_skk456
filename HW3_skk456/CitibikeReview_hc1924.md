## a)Comments on the  NULL HYPOTHESIS
###I believe the NULL Hypothesis responds to the IDEA: In winter people are less likely to use citibikesd than summer time.

##The alternative hypothesis is correctly stated for your given Null Hypothesis

## b)The data was correctly proccesed and the columns duration is fine to answer the question.But I am not sure using the np.abs(stats.zscore(summer_dur)) < 3) is the right way to do the Z-test.

## c) t-Test

##I would recommend t-Test because you are tesing if there is difference between two groups.
