HW4_skk456

Assignment 1 - 
Citibike peer review.
I forked the repository for Franz Loza (fhl204) and evaluated his Assignment 3 project.
I downloaded the HW3_3 ipython file to my compute environment and evaluated the code and verified the output.
I have recorded my peer review response in file CitibikeReview_skk456.md in Frank's PUI2016 > HW3 folder and sent him a Pull Request and informed him to accept it.
I have also retained a copy of my peer review in my PUI2016 > HW4 folder.

Assignment 2 - I have analyzed the papers by myself. Please refer my analysis below.

Assignment 3 and 4 - 
I have worked with Chenxi Cui (cc5219) for Assignment 2, 3 and 4.
I have also taken help from Yao Wang (yw2278) for the Extra Credit questions to understand the question and also for some areas in coding.
