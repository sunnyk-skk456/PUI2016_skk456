# Homework 6

## Assignment 1:

For this assignment I worked with Chenxi Cui (cc5219) and I followed the instructions listed in Dr. Bianco's skeleton notebook. 

## Assignment 2:

I worked with Shalmali Kulkarni (sck408) to test the null hypothesis and write a paper on our citibike project proposal. The link to the paper is - [Seasonal Dynamics of NYC Citibike Usage](https://www.authorea.com/users/106040/articles/134260/_show_article).

Note:
I and Shalmali worked on verifying the t-test program and validated the results on her computer. For unknown reason, the code is giving issue on my computer. I plan to meet and discuss this issue with the TA.
